# R-Projects
Here is a collection of some of my R Projects.
Each Project has an R-Markdown File where I wrote all the code, and a PDF file that was generated from that R-Markdown File.

Two-Sample T-Test Project (Dice Data):
In this Project I use a Two-Sample T-Test to determine if there is a difference between dice rolls made by my TA and me.

Regression Models Project (GPAs):
In this Project I use Simple Linear Regression Models and Multiple Linear Regression Models to predict the GPA of first year college students using variables.
These explanatory variables are SAT scores, High School GPA, whether the student is a first generation college student, the gender of the student and the number of humanities credits that will be taken in the first year of college.

ANOVA Project (Hospital Admissions):
In this Project I use ANOVA Models to determine if there is a relationship between the population mean hospital admissions, moon phases, and the month/season of the year.

Logistic Regression Project (Films):
In this Project I use Logistic Regression Models to what explanatory values are significant in helping predict how highly rated films will be.
These explanatory variables are location the film is from, the year of the film, the length of the film, how long the description of the film is and the number of listed cast members.

Variable Selection Analysis (Land Rent):
In this Project I use Variable Selection Analysis to determine how the rent for land planted to alfalfa relative to rent for other agricultural purposes changes with some vaiables.
These explanatory variables are the average rent paid for all tillable land in the area, the density of dairy cows, the proportion of farmland used as pasture, and a farming technique know as liming is required.
